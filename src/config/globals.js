          Finding the link to a Tweet you want to share isn't obvious, but it's
          also not difficult. Here is an easy method.
        </Typography>
        <ol>
          <li>Navigate to the Tweet</li>
          <li>Open the Share Menu</li>
          <li>Click the "Copy link to Tweet" Option</li>
        </ol>
        <Typography>Check if your link has the following format:</Typography>
        <Box sx={{ width: 1, wordWrap: "break-word" }}>
          <code>
            https://twitter.com/YourUsername/status/SomeRandomBigNumber
